Onboarding
"2 factor auth = something you know and somwrhinf ou have"
"chaz is a fun way to remeber why your friends are awesome"
Its what the humans think
keep onboarding very similar to how it is now.
     ask for name (store with device ID).
     if people dont use the app, dont make them create an account
     show people list of how other userâ€™s stored them

# Onboarding

When a user first engages with an app, she should see a clear path for success.
This means providing the right information at the right moments and guidance.


## chaz onboarding process

While chaz isn't complicated, it gives users a new experience that might
be unfamiliar. Therefore chaz provides a step-by-step guide
to reaching various "milestones" that make the app more fun and useful.

According to [name,link] from facebook, all products should lead users to that
magic "aha" moment. For chaz, that moment is when you decide what suggestion
based on your friend's score. Easier said than done!


Your data belongs to you, and unless it improves your experience as a user, chaz
does not mandate any user info. Users are prompted to provide only the following
info: name & phone#. this is so we can help you recover your recs in the event
you lose or break your phone. Also chaz gonna text you late at night.

### chaz onboarding overview

The user needs to put in quite a bit of work in order to get there, so chaz is
designed to make that process smooth and fun. That process can be broken into
these major stages:

- Add a recommendation with meta data, including who provided the recommendation
- Save enough recommendations that you build a queue for any given category (quantity unknown)
- Use your queue to help navigate a decision
- Go back to the app and "grade" that recommendation
- At this point, we suggest the user create an account
- Use your queue enough to grade at least 5 recs from at least 2 people
- Sort your queue by "score" to make a decision on what media to enjoy
- Provide feedback to your friends

getting filter options is a step in the onboarding
acheivements, n recs/rs rec types get you filter, adding timer.


 - get reminder, consume rec
 - give rec a grade (hooray!)
 - now recr has a score, user must see this




### How chaz implements this
link to ui video.
link to reducer of all the onboarding steps

chaz expands into several steps, each with two messages:
 a notification of the current state
 what to do next
also, "wheres what you just did" messages


### Phase 1
#### Pure Chaos
We have literal zero understanding why you downloaded the app, where you are,
who you are with, what mood you're in. Chaz is all about building stronger
empathetic relationships, so we dont want to assume anything here.
A simple message and a..


someone tells you something
that person
