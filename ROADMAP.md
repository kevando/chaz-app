# Roadmap



### 0.7 (make ux more fun, friend list)
update colors

go back to list item and improve

add rec is not a pop up

probly want to make it so rec and recr uses listener. i like that flow


 - Loading state is pulsing heart, with random color

### 0.8
this is the first version with recr view and rec view
  aka REFACTOR ROUTER SHIT!!
now that i have friend lists, refactor the firebase/state data so it makes more sense
friend score as emoji scale. make this part of the improved design shit
add Rec View, make this editable (because people will make typos)
add settings page with feedback form
add analytics (try using segment and or mixpanel)
refactor style code like spencer said to
change styling to more like podcasts/trello, consider ui improvement to add/edit flow
  add friend % to rec list,  and improve some of the styling with emojis

recr view has list of their recs, sortable, filterable
add recr % to global rec list


### 0.9 (Improve onboarding)
use emoji's for the categories, user score, grades, (more data)
animate log in, fun screen when there is no, or few recs

### 0.9
Your rec list is basically your chat list


### 1.0
 - Spend 2 days with spencer and refactor redux and firebase to a meteor server, refactor router, redesign data, add chat. possibly make this app like a tutorial app for spencer. open source it
 - more data (rec type, recr score by type)
 - App notifications.
