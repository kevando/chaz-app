rec note works, and edit rec note almost works
better way to style the note
consider refactoring add rec screen to be more of a abstract add data screen
assign emoji faces to recrs, give it some order or random
bug: fix how recView uses component state. its not quite right i dont think
revisit navbar style settings
create a redux array or something to create recType title or something
  use in add rec placeholder and title
add an updatedAt timestamp as well, with tracking here.

list style, focus on making look good for all situations (w recr)
