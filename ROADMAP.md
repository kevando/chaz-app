# Roadmap


### 0.6
Fix all the I/O bugs and make really great listeners with my new ref knowledge

change styling to more like podcasts/trello, consider ui improvement to add/edit flow
  add friend % to rec list,  and improve some of the styling with emojis

recr view has list of their recs, sortable, filterable
add recr % to global rec list


### 0.7 (make ux more fun)
default to sort by newest
bug: rec list renders 3 times. need to squash that shiet
add Rec View, make this editable (because people will make typos)
add settings page with feedback form
add analytics (try using segment and or mixpanel)
refactor style code like spencer said to

### 0.8
use emoji's for the categories, user score, grades, (more data)

### 0.9
Your rec list is basically your chat list

### Feature List
 - more data (rec type, recr score by type)
 - App notifications.
