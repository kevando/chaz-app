 "Chaz helps you remember the awesome things your friends tell you about" (this needs to be KILLER)
  chaz encourages you to develop deeper/better relationships with the people in your life by helping you remember why the recommend things do you
  giving us your phone number helps us communicate updates we make to your content
    for example, if you write down "that jim carey movie where he is a pet detective, we want to change it to ace venture, but we want to make sure you get a heads up"

  create user paths based on the "moment" in which they first open the app
    rather than guessing what their moment is, ask!
