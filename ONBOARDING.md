# Onboarding

Apple has taught everyone to expect the most frictionless experiences
and we love it. Part of that frictionless experience is showing people

## Here is a look at how we think about the onboarding process

phases. Each phase represents a task (or series of tasks) that end with a goal
that goal concludes that "phase" and user embarks on the next phase

 - store 5(?) recs with recr
 - get reminder, consume rec
 - give rec a grade (hooray!)
 - now recr has a score, user must see this

who you are with, what mood you're in. Chaz is all about building stronger
empathetic relationships, so we dont want to assume anything here.
A simple message and a..


someone tells you something
