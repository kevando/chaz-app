# Onboarding

Learning how to use a new product should be fun, engaging, leave no room for
confusion, so chaz holds your hand ever step of the way. It should also feel
very natural, so there is an extensive guide. NO OPTING OUT!

## chaz onboarding process

According to [name,link] from facebook, all products should lead users to that
magic "aha" moment. For chaz, that moment is when you decide what suggestion
based on your friend's score. Easier said than done!


The user needs to put in quite a bit of work in order to get there, so chaz is
designed to make that process smooth and fun. It takes time, so we broke the
process into stages:

 - Add rec with new recr
 - Repeat
 - Grade a Rec
 - Repeat
 - Ask user to create account

Your data belongs to you, and unless it improves your experience as a user, chaz
does not mandate any user info. Users are prompted to provide only the following
info: name & phone#. this is so we can help you recover your recs in the event
you lose or break your phone. Also chaz gonna text you late at night.

### chaz onboarding overview


getting filter options is a step in the onboarding
acheivements, n recs/rs rec types get you filter, adding timer. 


 - get reminder, consume rec
 - give rec a grade (hooray!)
 - now recr has a score, user must see this


### How chaz implements this
link to ui video.

chaz expands into several steps, each with two messages:
 a notification of the current state
 what to do next
also, "wheres what you just did" messages


### Phase 1
#### Pure Chaos
We have literal zero understanding why you downloaded the app, where you are,
who you are with, what mood you're in. Chaz is all about building stronger
empathetic relationships, so we dont want to assume anything here.
A simple message and a..


someone tells you something
that person
