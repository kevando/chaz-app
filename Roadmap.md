# Roadmap

installation is all fucked up.  fix this.

### 0.6
default to sort by newest
change styling to more like podcasts/trello, consider ui improvement to add/edit flow
  add friend % to rec list,  and improve some of the styling with emojis
bug: rec list renders 3 times. need to squash that shiet
recr view has list of their recs, sortable, filterable
add recr % to global rec list


### 0.7 (make ux more fun)
add Rec View, make this editable (because people will make typos)
add settings page with feedback form
add analytics (try using segment and or mixpanel)

### Feature List
 - more data (rec type, recr score by type)
 - App notifications.

### Onboarding Ideas
use phone# + text message to confirm users

beta onboarding idea:



### UI/UX concepts
Utilize horizontal scroll
onDelete = this rec will self destruct in 5 seconds. your friend gets notified if it blows up
