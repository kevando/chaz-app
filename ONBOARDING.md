# Onboarding

Users need to know how to use your product in order to use it.
Teaching them should be fun, interactive, and feel totally natural.


## chaz onboarding process

According to [name,link] from facebook, all products should lead users to that
magic "aha" moment. For chaz, that moment is when you decide what suggestion
based on your friend's score. Easier said than done!

The user needs to put in quite a bit of work in order to get there, so chaz is
designed to make that process as smooth and fun as possible.

Your data belongs to you, and unless it improves your experience as a user, chaz
does not mandate any user info. Users are prompted to provide only the following
info: name & phone#. this is so we can help you recover your recs in the event
you lose or break your phone. Also chaz gonna text you late at night.

### Phase 1
#### Pure Chaos
We have literal zero understanding why you downloaded the app, where you are,
who you are with, what mood you're in. Chaz is all about building stronger
empathetic relationships, so we dont want to assume anything here.
A simple message and a..


someone tells you something
that person
