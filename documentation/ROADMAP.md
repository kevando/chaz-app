# 0.8 workspace ------------------------------------------------------------

validate add rec, also rec note return bugs it out

break note into its own component and complete following style goal
better way to style the note
clicking note should let user edit it. make this look cool

note listitem looks weird, need to consolidate this



consider refactoring add rec screen to be more of a abstract add data screen
assign emoji faces to recrs, give it some order or random
bug: fix how recView uses component state. its not quite right i dont think
revisit navbar style settings
create a redux array or something to create recType title or something
  use in add rec placeholder and title
add an updatedAt timestamp as well, with tracking here.

list style, focus on making look good for all situations (w recr)
