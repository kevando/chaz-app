# Roadmap



### 0.7 (make ux more fun)
Create own custom activityindicator that is an animated emoji, change based on what is loading?
animate log in, fun screen when there is no, or few recs
loading should animate down, filling the page with color
add rec is not a pop up
Fix all the I/O bugs and make really great listeners with my new ref knowledge
default to sort by newest
bug: rec list renders 3 times. need to squash that shiet
add friend view with rec list. refactor the display code

### 0.8
now that i have friend lists, refactor the firebase/state data so it makes more sense
friend score as emoji scale. make this part of the improved design shit
add Rec View, make this editable (because people will make typos)
add settings page with feedback form
add analytics (try using segment and or mixpanel)
refactor style code like spencer said to
change styling to more like podcasts/trello, consider ui improvement to add/edit flow
  add friend % to rec list,  and improve some of the styling with emojis

recr view has list of their recs, sortable, filterable
add recr % to global rec list


### 0.8
use emoji's for the categories, user score, grades, (more data)

### 0.9
Your rec list is basically your chat list


### 1.0
 - Spend 2 days with spencer and refactor redux and firebase to a meteor server, refactor router, redesign data, add chat. possibly make this app like a tutorial app for spencer. open source it
 - more data (rec type, recr score by type)
 - App notifications.
